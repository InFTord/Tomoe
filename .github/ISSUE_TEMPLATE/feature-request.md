## What's your suggestion?

<!-- The user service should have user avatars available. -->

## Why do you feel this should be added?

<!-- I feel user avatars would make it easier to differentiate who's sending what message. It can also make it easier to tell if someone is impersonating someone else -->

## Do you have a rough idea of how this should be implemented? If so, how?

<!-- A new `avatar` property should be added to the `User` property, and a new `/api/v1/users/{id}/avatar` endpoint should be created. -->

## What gave you this idea? Was it related to a certain problem or inconvenience?

<!-- Other services such as Discord or Github have this feature, so why shouldn't we? -->

## Have any alternatives been considered?

<!-- Giving roles a color property and highlighting the user's username in with the role color -->

## Personal notes

<!-- I just really want to show off my avatar. -->
